### Part 1 ‑ Exploratory data analysis
Using timestamps of user logins in a particular geographic location, aggregate these login counts based on 15-minute time intervals, and visualize and describe the resulting time series of login counts in ways that best characterize the underlying patterns of the demand. 

### Part 2 ‑ Experiment and metrics design
Design an experiment for the neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis, such that driver partners are encouraged to be available in both cities, despite toll costs to travel between the cities. Describe the key measure of success. 

### Part 3 ‑ Predictive modeling of ride retention
Based on EDA, build a predictive model to help Ultimate determine whether or not a user will be active in their 6th month on the system.
